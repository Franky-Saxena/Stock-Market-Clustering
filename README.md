# Stock Market Clustering

In this project we will be extracting live Stock Market data from yahoo finance. We will find similarities amongst various companies using their stock stock market prices and then cluster them into different clusters using the K-means algorithm.

Note that this is an unsuppervised machine learning problem and will use an unsuppervised machine learning technique with the help of the K-means algorithm.

NB: "pandas_datareader" extract data from variouse internet sources into a Dataframe. Curently the following sources are supported

Yahoo! Finance
Google Finance
St. Louis FED (FRED)
Kenneth French's data library
World Bank
Google Analytics

In this project we uses the concept of the PCA also and the KMeans algorithm to the relationship.

In this project we applied the algorithm through the concept of the pipelines.

## To See Analyse of the data
run a jupyter notebook
```
run a 'Stock Market Clustering using KMeans.ipynb'
